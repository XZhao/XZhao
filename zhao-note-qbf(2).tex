$\Phi=\exists X\forall Y\exists Z \varphi$.

$x\in X$ once positive and once negative in $\varphi$.

Then $d(\varphi[x=1])=2$. Suppose $F[x=1]$ contains a MU(2) subformula $\varphi_{\neg x}$ then

$\exists X-\{x\}\forall Y\exists Z\varphi[x=1]$ if and only if $\exists X-\{x\}\forall Y\exists Z \varphi_{\neg x}$ is true.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For any two clauses $C_1, C_2$ in a MU(1) formula $F$. There is exactly one connecting path from $c_1$ to $C_2$. And the connecting literals are also fixed.

That is, if $c_1$ and $c_2$ connect each other via literals $L_1,\cdots, L_n$, there is no other connecting literals.
